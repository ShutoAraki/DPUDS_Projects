# Classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST data set

This exploration will use neural networks and tensorflow to examine how handwritten digits can be 
classified by computers.

Some resources to check out if you're interested in learning more about machine learning:

1) http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html

This project is heavily based on chapter 1, and will base much of its code on what the author provides for us. This
is a great read for anyone who wants to learn more about machine learning/neural networks.

2) https://docs.google.com/a/depauw.edu/presentation/d/1OePEVvaUG33XgSXMQJM7FdtVNCKoVhNPT2v_jRpl1us/edit?usp=sharing

If you're not a fan of reading a dense book about neural networks, I made a slide presentation that may make it easier
to understand.

3) https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners

Although we will be building our neural network from scratch, TensorFlow provides a great neural network library
and is great for people who don't want to get into the nitty gritty (i.e. mathematics) of machine learning.

This is the code that our import_mnist.py file borrows from. I made a few changes to make it compatible with
Python 3 and to make comments explaining what each part of it does.
