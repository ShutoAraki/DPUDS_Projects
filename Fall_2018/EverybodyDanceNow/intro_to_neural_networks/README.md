# Introduction to Neural Networks
@author ShutoAraki

@version 10/03/2018

## Requirement/Recommendation
- Understanding of what classes and objects are in any programming language
- Basic Python experience
- Background in some Calculus (partial differentiation) and some Linear Algebra (matrix multiplications) would be helpful, but not required
- About at least 10 hours of your time

## First, watch [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) as you take notes (like really carefully)
<strong>Don't just watch the videos and think you understood the basics.</strong> Make sure you are taking notes and listing questions. Google those questions and read whatever comes up slowly. 

This conceptual understanding should take a lot of time and that's normal. It is one of the most important skills that you can learn what you didn't know yesterday by googling today.

## Also, you can play around with [this interactice web app](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.91832&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) and have fun!


## Second, start diving into the code
Eli Anderson did an awesome project last year! You can take a look at [his code](https://github.com/DPUDS/DPUDS_Projects/blob/master/Fall_2017/MNIST/network.py) and see if you can translate your conceptual understanding into code.
